The aim of the dissertation was to propose and implement a new novel approach for the general architecture used for creating Semantic Web applications.
This included :-
i. A new methodology which does not reduce functionalities currently available through the generic approach in use.
ii. Reduced complexity in terms of creating client-side applications.
iii. Enriched experience for the users, an all-in-one integrated approach, instead of relying on add-ons/plugins for the browsers/clients.
iv. Usage of a custom HTTP-esque protocol
v. Moved the complexities to the server side (Inferencing, derivations, et. al)
